# Main Watcher — project context

Main Watcher is a reusable component that continuously runs a repo's .NET/xUnit v3
integration tests on `main`. On failure it opens a GitHub issue listing the failing tests
and every push since the last green run. While that issue is open, it blocks the repo's
GitHub merge queue; only PRs labelled `fixes-main` can still merge. It also reports test
durations and the slowest tests.

**Status:** architecture designed (2026-09-15). No code has been written yet.

## Where things are

- `docs/architecture/architecture.md` — the main document (ARCH-001). Start here.
- `docs/architecture/decisions/` — ADR-001 to ADR-012.
  - ADR-005 is superseded by ADR-007; ADR-006 is superseded by ADR-009.
  - Accepted ADRs are never edited. A changed decision gets a new ADR that supersedes or
    amends the old one, plus a note at the top of the old one.
- `docs/architecture/test-strategy.md` — TS-001: scenario tests TS-S1–S13, unit tests
  TS-U1–U7.
- `docs/architecture/artifact-index.md` — what exists, what was deliberately not produced,
  and why.
- `docs/architecture/diagrams/` — PNG renders. The Mermaid sources inside the markdown are
  authoritative.
- `.claude/skills/architecture-design/` — the design skill used to produce these documents,
  including its validation scripts.

## Design in one paragraph

**Trigger worker.** A self-hosted .NET `BackgroundService` on Kubernetes, outbound HTTPS
only. Every 60 s it checks each target through the read-only `mw-observer` App. When there
is work, it starts `watch.yml` in the watcher repo through the `mw-doorbell` App
(ADR-010). It raises alerts as `watcher-infra` issues (ADR-012).

**watch.yml.** Using the `main-watcher` App, it:
- creates a check run on the target commit;
- starts the target repo's `main-watcher-tests.yml` with `return_run_details`, and stores
  the run ID in the check run's `external_id`;
- when that run finishes, reads its CTRF artifact and opens, updates or closes the
  `main-broken` lock issue.

**Target repos.**
- Their test workflow calls a shared reusable workflow with `secrets: inherit`, so each
  repo owns its test secrets (ADR-009).
- The results contract is exit code plus CTRF JSON (ADR-007).
- A gate workflow in each target is a required merge-queue check. It fails merge groups
  while an App-authored lock is open, unless every PR in the group is labelled
  `fixes-main`, and it fails open on API errors (ADR-002, ADR-008).

**State and scheduling.**
- All state lives in GitHub: check runs, the lock issue, and hidden markers (ADR-003).
- A green run auto-closes the lock; a human close counts as an override (ADR-004).
- An hourly GitHub schedule is only a backup sweep.

**Timings (phase 1).** They appear in the run's job summary (the CTRF reporter action) and
in the check run output, and are saved as `timings.json` in the artifact (ADR-011). An own
metrics store (PostgreSQL + Grafana) is deferred.

## Open items before building

1. Confirm the cluster has outbound HTTPS to `api.github.com` and a secret store (A-6).
2. Get security approval for `actions: write` on target repos for the `main-watcher` App
   (R-11).
3. Run sandbox test TS-S5 early: batched merge groups and the gate (A-5, R-3).
4. Verify team @-mentions from an App notify the team (TS-S10, R-10).
5. Verify CTRF duration units shown by the reporter action (TS-S13, R-17).
6. Remaining `[assumption]` tags: worker resource sizing, .NET and Node versions, sandbox
   organisation name.

## Suggested next steps

1. The `user-stories` backlog, or go straight to the build.
2. Build order:
   1. Gate workflow and sandbox (retires the biggest risk).
   2. Reusable test workflow + caller template.
   3. `watch.yml` (Planner and Reporter).
   4. Trigger worker.
   5. Onboarding docs.

## Validating the docs after edits

Run from the project root (needs Python 3; diagram checks need Node/npm):

```
python .claude/skills/architecture-design/scripts/check_consistency.py docs/architecture
python .claude/skills/architecture-design/scripts/check_freshness.py docs/architecture
python .claude/skills/architecture-design/scripts/render_diagrams.py docs/architecture --check
```

Expected output: four "cites superseded ADR" notices for ADR-005 and ADR-006. They are
intentional history references.

## Conventions

- **IDs:**
  - FR / NFR / C (constraints) / A (assumptions) / R (risks) / Q;
  - CQ = confirmation-queue items (all settled);
  - TS-S = scenario tests, TS-U = unit tests.
- **Front matter:** every doc has an owner, reviewed date and review-by date. Update
  `reviewed` and the change log in `architecture.md` §20 when you edit.
- **Tags:** `[assumption]` and `[open]` mark unconfirmed statements.
